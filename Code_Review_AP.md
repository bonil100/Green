On a scale of 1 to 5, I give this code a rating of __5__ based on the following criteria:

1  The program has syntax errors and does not compile, or the project does not provide sufficient information to instal necessary dependencies.
2  The program compiles successfully but generates runtime errors. or the project does not contain sufficeint instructions to run the program.
3  The program compiles and runs but does not perform correctly and does not produce correct results
4  The program compiles and produces correct output but does not follow assignment/class guidelines or is insufficiently documented
5  The program produces correct output and is well written and well documented

Suggestions for improving the project:
The program compiles and generates the tweets as it says it will. I recommend using a while loop over the program and allow the user to search for tweets again or quit the program. I also would also ask the user repeatedly until they put the correct input instead of exiting out. Other than that the code was well written and documented.
